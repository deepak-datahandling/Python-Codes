### STATUS:
  It is the initially developed code version, Later I will try to include more features and update the version.

### PROS:
1. At a single time it can be able to compare millons of records and give you the results.
2. We can use more than single stats like count,min,max etc.,
3. Time consumption was less.
4. we can avoid human errors while comparing the records.

### CONS:
1. Perfermance will be less compared to Pyspark.
2. No Optimization techniques used for now.
 
### Features can be added:
1. Here while entereing the Teradata password it was visible, so to avoid this we can go for dbutils secrets.
2. Since we are predominantly using Pandas dataframe the performance may be less compared to Pyspark, So I was trying to implement the same in Pyspark.
3. Mail features can be added and am working on it.
